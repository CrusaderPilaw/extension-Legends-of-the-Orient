# Legends of the Orient

Many mods have been released since the UCP came into existence, but there has never been an English one — until now.
I am proud to present my **"Legends Of The Orient"** mod pack!
Here’s what you can expect:

### Eight fully reworked Vanilla AIs.
Let's face it: Stronghold Crusader is a very old game! To this day, it remains popular mainly due to its nostalgia. My goal was to maintain and even extend this nostalgia. That's why I retained the first eight AIs from the base game: from Rat to Wolf as well as from Sultan to Saladin.  
*However, I have revived all of them by sharpening their character traits, reworking their economies, and giving them new castles and abilities on the battlefield!*  
  
### Eight all new lords, thought up and designed by me.
My own AIs build upon the base game lore. This gives them more justification within the Stronghold universe, as they engage and add to the existing storyline of the other games.  I have showcased this lore in some handmade [story trailers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4AaKaABcTQ&list=PLBN1Qfc9HaOUkFHLpETwAmZYOI0I-Y4Ae).  
  
For a preview and explanation of all changes and the new lords, please check out my [YouTube Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxP-eylX_Q4&list=PLBN1Qfc9HaOVOKqq8hps0GH84vONNWqEg).  
Otherwise, check out the Preview parchment below!  
  
### My own AIs are voiced by professional voice actors.
In my opinion, the main strength of the base game has always been the characters of the AIs, presented primarily through their messages. That's why I didn't hold back and hired professional voice actors on Fiverr to voice all my AIs, ensuring they are on par with the vanilla ones!
