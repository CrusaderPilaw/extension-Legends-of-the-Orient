# Legends of the Orient

Many mods have been released since the UCP came into existence, but there has never been an English one — until now.
I am proud to present my **"Legends Of The Orient"** mod pack!
Here’s what you can expect:

### Eight fully reworked Vanilla AIs.
Let's face it: Stronghold Crusader is a very old game! To this day, it remains popular mainly due to its nostalgia. My goal was to maintain and even extend this nostalgia. That's why I retained the first eight AIs from the base game: from Rat to Wolf as well as from Sultan to Saladin.  
*However, I have revived all of them by sharpening their character traits, reworking their economies, and giving them new castles and abilities on the battlefield!*  
  
### Eight all new lords, thought up and designed by me.
My own AIs build upon the base game lore. This gives them more justification within the Stronghold universe, as they engage and add to the existing storyline of the other games.  I have showcased this lore in some handmade [story trailers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4AaKaABcTQ&list=PLBN1Qfc9HaOUkFHLpETwAmZYOI0I-Y4Ae).  
  
For a preview and explanation of all changes and the new lords, please check out my [YouTube Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxP-eylX_Q4&list=PLBN1Qfc9HaOVOKqq8hps0GH84vONNWqEg).  
Otherwise, check out the Preview parchment below!  
  
### My own AIs are voiced by professional voice actors.
In my opinion, the main strength of the base game has always been the characters of the AIs, presented primarily through their messages. That's why I didn't hold back and hired professional voice actors on Fiverr to voice all my AIs, ensuring they are on par with the vanilla ones!

### A fully reworked extreme trail featuring all the new characters.
My 'Legendary Trail' offers you 20 new missions on 20 new maps, handcrafted and designed to perfectly fit my AIs!


# AI Preview: Meet the new characters

If you want to spice up your first encounter with my new AIs you can challenge them at their prime: My homeland maps are designed to create the perfect surroundings for each of my AIs.
They offer just the right amount of resources as well as some neat little surprises regarding landscape, secret routes and other, more general AI behaviour. 

You will find the maps in your game once you installed my pack ("Heimatland: xy").
Set up some custom skirmishes as shown below and confront my AIs in their natural habitat!
The enemy team positions should be exactly as recommended.
I would suggest normald mode and simple AI advantage; 2000 gold for yourself and 4000 for the AIs.

# Legendary Trail
### Twenty new missions, twenty new challenges
![Image](https://github.com/CrusaderPilaw/extension-Legends-of-the-Orient/blob/main/locale/Legendary_Trail.png?raw=true)
This is the centrepiece of my modpack, providing what is and always has been the core of the game: a series of skirmish missions, advancing in difficulty, challenging your abilities to manage your castle as well as the hostile land surrounding it.
The trail makes use of the 'custom skirmish trail' module, providing new features und functions that allow for story telling and derived restrictions for recruitment, production and trade. These missions don't simply get harder due to more enemy AIs with more gold. Everything matters: Your position on the map, the resources you have access to and are able to buy or sell, the technologies at hand and... some unique little details and mechanics that may make for some interesting side quests - or uncomfortable surprises.


# Credits
### I bow down to the glory of Gynt!
Tiptip tap type, 
As Gynts fingertips go numb,
He has to work late every night,
'Cause Vanilla code is so dumb.

The lonely man at the front, preserving and continuing the work we all rely on!
